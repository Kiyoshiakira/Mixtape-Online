# Monetization Strategy — Playlist Master & Mixtape Watch Together

We believe in open source and free community tools, but to keep building and improving, we need sustainable funding.  
Here’s how we plan to do it:

## 1. Freemium Model

- **Free Tier:**  
  - All core features, personal mixtapes, and basic watch together rooms
- **Premium Tier:**  
  - Advanced sync (larger rooms, exclusive chat/avatars, VR enhancements)
  - Curated “official” mixtapes
  - Enhanced automation (bulk import, notifications)
  - Custom branding/themes

## 2. Hosted SaaS

- **Self-host:** Free and open source
- **Official Hosted Service:**  
  - Paid accounts for convenience, reliability, and premium features

## 3. Donations & Sponsorships

- GitHub Sponsors, Patreon, Ko-fi
- Early supporter perks, custom badges

## 4. Marketplace (Future)

- Community-curated mixtape marketplace (creators can get tips, you get a small cut)

## 5. Consulting & Customization

- Offer branded setups for organizations, VR arcades, or clubs

*We’re committed to keeping core features open and free. Paid features help us grow, support hosting, and reward contributors.*
