# Mixtape Master & Mixtape Watch Together

**Curate, share, and watch your favorite shows together — anywhere, any time, on any device.**

## What is This Project?

Playlist Master is an open source platform for creating and sharing “video mixtapes” — custom playlists of TV episodes, movies, or web videos — and enjoying them solo or with friends in a synchronized “living room” experience, on PC and in VR.

## Features

- Curate mixtapes from any streaming service (Netflix, Hulu, Crunchyroll, YouTube, etc.)
- Discover and share public mixtapes contributed by the community
- Synchronized playback for “watch together” sessions (PC, browser, VR)
- Browser extension for quick episode-saving
- Electron desktop app for “virtual monitor” playback
- VR-friendly guides and future WebXR support
- Open source, privacy-first, and community-driven

## How Does Monetization Work?

The core platform and community features are free and open source.  
We’ll offer **premium features** (advanced sync, curated content, customization) and **official hosted accounts** for supporters.  
See [Monetization.md](Monetization.md) for details.
